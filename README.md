This project investigates the running time of different algorithms for calculating similarities between pairs of documents. Using data derived from word frequencies in extracts of "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy, this analysis explores both theoretical and empirical aspects of algorithm performance. Key similarity measures analyzed include Cosine Similarity and Jaccard Similarity. The project also evaluates the impact of parallel computing and alternative matrix multiplication techniques, like Strassenâ€™s method, on performance efficiency. This study is part of a Data Science Master's project at the University of Sussex.
